A long time ago, in the 10th century, a large castle was built in Germany called the Eltz castle.
It was near current day Berlin Flughafen. 
There were many knights in this city, each of them being very wettbewerbsfaehig.
They usually gathered in the Biergarten.
One day, they were all dressed in lederhosen, and gathered in a circle for a war.
